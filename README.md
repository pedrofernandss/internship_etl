## Description

This is a specialized bot designed to search and find remote internship and/or entry-level software engineer and data science opportunities in Brazil. The collected information is sent to a specific Discord channel to facilitate message organization and notification receipt.

## Objective
Given the difficulty in finding job opportunities for beginners, my goal with this project is to help my friends find work and enter the industry. To achieve this, I developed this bot, which notifies them as soon as a job opening is posted. 

I believe that, due to the high competition in the job market, those who apply as quickly as possible have a higher chance of passing the first stage and being invited to move forward in the selection process.
