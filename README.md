# Internship ETL

This project consist in an **ETL pipeline (Extract → Transform → Load)** to collect, process, and notify internship and junior-level tech job openings via Discord.  

The goal is to **practice data engineering concepts**, including extracting data from external APIs, performing light transformations (field filtering and standardization), and storing historical data in a database.  

At the same time, the bot helps users **find opportunities quickly**, as faster applications can increase the chances of advancing in selection processes.
