## Job Scout

![alt text](assets/scout_image.png)

## Description

This is a specialized bot designed to search and find remote internship and/or entry-level software engineer and data science opportunities in Brazil. The collected information is sent to a specific Discord channel to facilitate message organization and notification receipt.

## Objective
Given the difficulty in finding job opportunities for beginners, my goal with this project is to help my friends find work and enter the industry. To achieve this, I developed this bot, which notifies them within an hour as soon as a job opening is posted. 

I believe that, due to the high competition in the job market, those who apply as quickly as possible have a higher chance of passing the first stage and being invited to move forward in the selection process.

## Technologies
Since this only a Proof of Concept, I choose to work with:

- Python
- SQLite

## Deploy

The project is deployed on Railway and has a Github Actions attatched to the `main` branch for continuous deployment.

## Next Steps
In order to expand my job search, I intend to perform web scraping of LinkedIn Jobs listings using the BeautifulSoup library to extract relevant information such as job descriptions, company, location, and prerequisites. This will help me gather more data and broaden the scope of my search, optimizing the identification of opportunities suitable for a university student profile.
